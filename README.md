Snek, my snake game.

Tested in:
	- Chrome Version 58.0.3029.81
	- Firefox 53

Usage:
	Open index.html with Firefox or Chrome. That should load the game.

This game could be expanded on by having preset settings per map size/difficulty. There could also be special food items that spawn and give extra points or a speed boost/reduction. Due to the increasing complexity, we may consider using a CSS preprocessor such as SASS, a data-driven UI system like React, and a module loader like Webpack/Babel/ES6.
